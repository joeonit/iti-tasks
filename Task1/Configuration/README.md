# Personal Access Token

A **personal access token (PAT)** is a security token that individuals can use to authenticate themselves to access a particular service or system. It's a form of credentials that allows a user to interact with an application or API (Application Programming Interface) without needing to provide their username and password.

Personal access tokens are commonly used in the context of software development and APIs. For example, many version control systems, like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, allow users to generate personal access tokens to authenticate and interact with their repositories programmatically. This avoids the need to use a username and password directly, providing a more secure and manageable way to access services.

When creating a personal access token, users typically specify the scope of permissions or access rights associated with the token. This helps control what actions the token can perform on behalf of the user. It's essential to keep personal access tokens secure and not share them publicly, as they grant access to sensitive data and actions.

The exact process of creating and using personal access tokens may vary depending on the service or platform you're working with, so it's advisable to refer to the documentation of the specific service for detailed instructions.
