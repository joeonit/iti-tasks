Benefits of Personal Access Tokens:

Personal access tokens provide a secure way for individuals to access applications or services without exposing their username and password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

They enable automated interactions with services, especially in software development and APIs. Developers can use tokens to authenticate and perform actions programmatically without manual intervention.Users can specify the exact permissions or actions a token is allowed to perform. This fine-grained control enhances security by limiting the token's capabilities to only what is necessary.
